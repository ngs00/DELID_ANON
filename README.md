# Self-Supervised Conditional Diffusion for Coarse-Graining Molecular Representation Learning

## Abstract
Electron-level information is an essential attribute determining the physical and chemical properties of molecules. However, the electron-level information is not accessible in most real-world molecules due to extensive computational costs to determine uncertain electronic structures. For this reason, existing methods for molecular representation learning have remained in the representation learning on simplified atom-level molecular descriptors. This paper proposes a molecular representation learning method based on a self-supervised conditional diffusion method to estimate the electron-level information about arbitrary complex real-world molecules from readily accessible fragmented information. The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art prediction accuracy on extensive real-world molecular datasets.


## Run
- ``exec.py``: A script to train and evaluate DELID for a given dataset.


## Datasets
We employed nine benchmark molecular datasets constructed by real-world chemical experiments.
The benchmark molecular datasets were selected from well-known databases in molecular science and biology [1,2,3,4].
For comprehensive evaluations, we selected the benchmark molecular datasets from four different chemical applications: physicochemistry, toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and optics.
The characteristics of the benchmark molecular datasets are summarized in the paper.
